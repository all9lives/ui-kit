# This is the UI Kit powered by `storybook` and `styled-components`
This repository contains some basic components that we find using them a lot in other projects. We use it as a foundation of other components for both web and app development.

## Known Issues
- Currently Jest is not resolving files based on `Platform` correctly.
- Can't use git submodules in react-native project (module duplicated)
